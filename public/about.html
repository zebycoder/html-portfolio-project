<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m a passionate and detail-oriented web designer with a strong foundation in Java programming, HTML, and website development. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive websites that not only look great but also function seamlessly across devices. My expertise in Java allows me to integrate dynamic and interactive elements into my designs, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. Whether it’s crafting a sleek landing page or building a complex web application, I thrive on turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and well-structured code.</p>

<p>In addition to my design and development skills, I have hands-on experience in manual software testing using the Jira tool. This has equipped me with a keen eye for identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and ensuring that every project I work on meets the highest standards of quality. I believe that great design goes hand in hand with functionality, and my testing background allows me to bridge the gap between aesthetics and usability. I’m passionate about delivering projects that are not only visually stunning but also robust, reliable, and user-centric.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding or designing, I’m constantly exploring new trends and technologies in the web development world to stay ahead of the curve. I enjoy collaborating with teams, solving complex problems, and taking on challenges that push me to grow both professionally and creatively.
